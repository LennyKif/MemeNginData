How to create custom assets.

- The id field must be specified as 0 and is automatically specified when created.
- asset.json needs to located in a same folder of its asset
- following is asset.json example.

{
    "id": 0,
    "name": "Acme",
    "path": "Acme/Acme-Regular.ttf",
    "icon": "Acme/icon.png",
    "type": "font"
}

from above,

1. path & icon is relative path from current asset type
2. we are assuming that asset is located in 'assets/fonts/Acme/Acme-Regular.ttf'
